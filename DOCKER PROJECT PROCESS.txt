DOCKER PROJECT PROCESS:
---------------------------------------

1) Create 3 EC2 instance and install docker in it 

		make 1 as master and other 2 as workers
		in master perform below:
		-----------------------------------
		sudo -i
		yum install docker -y
		systemctl start docker
		docker swarm init
		copy & paste the token in both the workers
		
		in workers nodes:
		--------------------------
		sudo -i
		yum install docker -y
		systemctl start docker
		paste the token here


2) upload the Dockerfile, compose.yml files in the GitHub repo

		https://github.com/sairohitchinta/dockerproject.git


3) Now change the permissions and restart the docker service in master node

		chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
		systemctl daemon-reload
		systemctl restart docker

4) Install Jenkins in master and configure it
		
		using script which is available in my GitHub : https://github.com/sairohitchinta/mysetups.git


5) Create a pipeline project which takes parameters

		ADD PARAMETER TO IT BY RUNNING THE BUILD BY CHANING THE CONTENT IN INDEX.HTML

		

	
	pipeline{
	agent any
	
	stages{
		stage('git checkout'){
			steps{
				git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/sairohitchinta/dockerproject.git'
			}
		}
		stage('build'){
			steps{
				sh 'docker build -t $img_name . '
			}
		}
		stage('tag & push'){
			steps{
				sh '''
				docker tag $img_name $repo
				docker login -u sairohitchinta -p $password
				docker push $repo
				'''
			}
		}
		stage('deploy'){
			input{
				message ' do you wish to continue?'
				ok 'yes'	
			}
			steps{
				sh ' docker stack deploy -c compose.yml paytm'
			}
		}
	}
}


6) HERE WE HAVE FOUR SERVICES(MOVIES, TRAINS, RECHARGE, DTH) RUN FOR 4 TIME WITHOUT DEPLOY STAGE

		AFTER UPLOADING COMPOSE.YML FILE , RUN FOR THE 5 TIME INCLUDING DEPLOY STAGE


7) COPY THE PUBLIC IP OF EVERY EC2 INSTANCE AND PASTE IN THE BROWSER LIKE BELOW

		
		MOVIES:
			MASTER_PUBLIC_IP:81
			WORKER1_PUBLIC_IP:81
			WORKER2_PUBLIC_IP:81

		TRAINS:
			MASTER_PUBLIC_IP:82
			WORKER1_PUBLIC_IP:82
			WORKER2_PUBLIC_IP:82

		RECHARGE:
			MASTER_PUBLIC_IP:83
			WORKER1_PUBLIC_IP:83
			WORKER2_PUBLIC_IP:83

		DTH:
			MASTER_PUBLIC_IP:84
			WORKER1_PUBLIC_IP:84
			WORKER2_PUBLIC_IP:84
